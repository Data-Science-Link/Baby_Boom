Caveats:
"1. 'Missing County' appears when county data is not available for a certain year. This occurs because the county did not meet"
"minimum population standards and thus the data for the county was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category for the"
"state of the county. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Locations."
"2. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"3. County-level data are shown only for counties with populations of 100,000 persons or more. Within each state, data for all"
"counties with fewer than 100,000 persons are combined together under the label ""Unidentified Counties""."
"4. <p> As a result of population changes the following counties do not have data available for all years.<br/> Before 2014 the"
"data for the following counties was recoded to the ""Unidentified Counties"" category within the state of the county because"
"they did not meet minimum population standards. Houston County, AL (01069); Navajo County, AZ (04017); Faulkner County, AR"
